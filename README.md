# Helper-Bot

Helper Bot is an AI chatbot that help users find mutual aid funds based on their location, marginalized group they belong to, or services they require. 

The chatbot was built using Node.js and the 'node.nlp' library. 

Prereqs:
- Node.js must be installed on your machine.
- Must have access to MongoDB 

Features I plan on adding and working on:
- Implementing a web scraper to retrieve necessary information about mutual aid funds and adding them to my database.
