# Helper-Bot

Helper Bot is a chat bot intended to help users with a myriad of things. 

Features I plan on adding and working on:
- A display of chat history. 
- Display of messages between client and bot, right now responses can only be observed after running the backend code. 
- Developing a focus on helping users find mutual aid organizations wether they need it for themselves or want to donate to one. 
- Deploy.
