# Helper-Bot

Helper Bot is a chat bot intended to help users find mutual aid funds. So far I've implemented NLP technologies to respond based
on sentiment. 

Features I plan on adding and working on:
- A display of chat history. 
- Display of messages between client and bot. 
- Creating a database of mutual aid funds.
